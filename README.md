- Since I used apple's screenshot utility, this program is macOS only.
- Press the left mouse button, drag mouse a small distance horizontally, then release the mouse to perform a DRAG
- Perform 4 DRAGs anywhere to start a rhythm. (The rhythm frequenvy is based on the interval of first 4 DRAGs)
- When rhythm is in. DRAG on any area that has color variations on the screen. Note DRAG need to be performed with horizontal displacement. Otherwise will not play. DRAG on a color palette is an good example
